## Project Overview

The analysis is based on a dataset of 595 job postings related to data roles such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst.  
The data includes information on job titles, salaries, cities, and other details.  
After cleaning and organizing the dataset using Python, visualizations were created in Tableau to present the insights in an interactive way.

This project combines coding-based data analysis with dashboard design to provide a complete view of the UK data job market.
